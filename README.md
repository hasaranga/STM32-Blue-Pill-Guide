## Using STM32CubeIDE
Download and install **STM32CubeIDE** and **ST-LINK Utility**. Start **STM32CubeIDE** and create a new STM32 project. It will show **Targer Selection** window. Select **STM32F103C8** as **Part No**. Press **Next** button. Enter the project name and browse a folder to save the project. Set **Target Language** as C. Set **Target Binary Type** to Executable. Set **Target Project Type** to STM32Cube. Click **Nex**t and then press **Finish**. 

Double click on your **project.ioc** file. Go to **Pinout & Configuration** tab and then click on **System Core**. Click on **RCC** and then set **High Speed Clock(HSE)** to **Crystal/Ceramic Resonator**. Click on **SYS** and then set **Debug** to **Serial Wire**. 

Go to **Pinout view** and then left click on **PC13** pin. Select **GPIO_Output** from the popup menu.

Go to **System view** and then press **GPIO** blue button. Click on **PC13** row on **Pin Name** column. Type **LED** as **User Label**.

Go to **Clock Configuration** tab and the configure it according to the following image.

Go to **Project** menu and then press **Generate Code**. 
**Core->Src->main.c** is your main source file. You can add new code within the **USER CODE BEGIN** and **USER CODE END** comment blocks. 

To blink the default LED, put following code within the while loop.

Go to **Project** menu and then press **Build All**.  It will create your **project.bin** file in **Debug** folder. We will use this file to flash our board using ST Link utility.

## Flashing STM32 Blue Pill

Connect **ST-Link v2** (clone) into the **Blue Pill** according to the pinout as specified on the dongle. Some dongles may have incorrect pin out specifications. Remove the metal cover and compare it with the labels on PCB. (Pushing the usb port by finger will remove the cover.) Jumpers on Blue Pill should be set to zero side.

**Warning**: Never power the Blue Pill from more than one source. Example; do not plug in the USB on the Blue Pill when 3.3V from the ST-LINK is connected. If you do want to power from the USB, then first disconnect the 3.3V from the ST-LINK.

Plug the **ST-Link** dongle into the PC. Run the **ST-LINK Utility**. Go to **Target** menu and press **Settings**. Set **Mode** to **Normal** and **Reset Mode** to **Software System Reset**. If you get any errors, put the **BOOT0** jumper to **1** side. (set it to 0 side after flashing)

Go to **Target** menu and press **Program...**
Browse the **project.bin** file in **Debug** folder.
Check the **Reset after programming** check box. And then press the **Start** button. It should flash the Blue Pill with the given bin file. 

When the flashing finishes the LED should be blink according to our program! When you update the bin file, you should close the already opened file in **ST-LINK Utility**. otherwise it will use the old file from memory.

## Debugging Support

We need to use OpenOCD as our debugger (GDB will not work).
Find the config file : **stm32f1x.cfg**

**C:\ST\STM32CubeIDE_1.5.0\STM32CubeIDE\plugins\com.st.stm32cube.ide.mcu.debug.openocd_1.5.0.202011091203\resources\openocd\st_scripts\target**

Add the following near the top of **stm32f1x.cfg** (before the first If â€“ statement):
**set CPUTAPID 0**

The zero tells OpenOCD to ignore id numbers, which means all clones or genuine MCUs will work.

Go to **STM32CubeIDE** and press the **Debug** button.
It will open debug configuration window. Go to Debugger tab and then set configuration according to following image. (you may need to press **Show Generator Options** button.)

Now you are ready to debug your code line by line!
